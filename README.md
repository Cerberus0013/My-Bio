# My-Bio


This is small project I put together to practice my HTML and CSS. Letting this up in HTML is relatively easy, a little bit of difficulty when I was styling the sheet.

It took some trial and error to line up my two sections and one address section all on the same row, and at the same height. 

I will still need to learn how to diplay a a lcal photo from my computer. The photos from my computer wouldn't work, so I had to download the one from my linkedin profile and connect that one using a relative pathway.
